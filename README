Introduction:
This game was written as a College Assignment for DTU. After leaving it alone
for quite some time, I decided to revisit the terrible code I had once been
proud of, and try to improve upon it.

Dependencies:
This project requires the pygame library. In order to run Cyborg-Fu, you must
download pygame.
